When reviewing this code, follow a systematic categorization, beginning with the central hub, index.html. Next, navigate to enrolled.html, and from there, proceed to links.html. Further exploration leads to cscatalog.html, mathcatalog.html, or sciencecatalog.html. Within each category, you'll find subcategories, such as algebra 1 and algebra 2 under math, and biology, chemistry, and physics under science. Finally, within the cscatalog, you'll encounter C-C++, javascript-html, and java.html.
